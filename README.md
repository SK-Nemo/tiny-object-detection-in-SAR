Tiny Object Detection in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)
This project aims to detect tiny objects in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using advanced deep learning techniques. SAR images are typically used for applications like remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. However, detecting small objects in SAR images is challenging due to noise, speckle, and low resolution.

Overview
The goal of this repository is to provide an end-to-end solution for tiny object detection in SAR images. The project uses a deep learning-based approach, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer-based models, to identify and classify tiny objects in SAR imagery.

Key features of this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Techniques for preparing and augmenting SAR images for deep learning models.
Model Architecture: A choice of state-of-the-art object detection models tailored for SAR images.
Evaluation Metrics: Methods for evaluating the performance of the model, including precision, recall, F1 score, and mAP (mean Average Precision).
Visualization: Tools for visualizing detection results on SAR images.
